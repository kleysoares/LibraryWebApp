# LibraryWebApp

In a nutshell, the exercise proposal was:

Your college has asked you for an online library system for the current library books in stock and any new ones that will be purchased. The system the college currently uses is paper based and they would like an automated system.

So, the design and implementation of a web based application for the college was created to allow students to login and search for books and to check them out via a web system.

Two dashboards were created and can be accessed according to login persmissions:

<strong>Student</strong> &#8658; the student should be able to log into the system and search for a book from the library. They should be able to check out a book and view all their currently books along with the due date.

<strong>Admin</strong> &#8658; the system admin should be able to login and view all books currently checked out, indicating which student has checked out the book. They should also be able to view all books that have been checked out and books that are past their due date as well as input a new book to the new library web system.
